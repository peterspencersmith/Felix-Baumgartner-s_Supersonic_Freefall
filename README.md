This repository contains a Python code which models Felix Baumgartnerâ€™s supersonic freefall using variations of the Euler method, which solves the differential equation describing the motion of an object in free fall.

A pdf is also included providing a detailed description of the archetecture of the code, the mathematical framework on which it is based and a full analysis and discussion of the plots produced by the simulation.
